NEXT STEPS
- Add computer intelligence: have computer select cards for crib such that remaining hand scores as high as possible during combination counting phase; when possible, have computer play cards that would complete 15s, 31, pairs, or runs during 'play' and 'go' phases.
- Add teacher value: in addition to printing rules of game play, have teacher provide feedback on accuracy of choices.
- Add GUI to show Cribbage board, pegs, and cards.
